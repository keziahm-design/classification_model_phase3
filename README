 # OverView
creating a model that has high prediction for customers that will stop working with Syria telecommunication company that is having a high revenue lose due to the customers that stop working with them.
 # business problem
Syria Tel is losing revenue due to customers that are leaving
 # Objective
### 
1. predict whether a customer would leave so Syria Tel can intervine early and reduce revenue loss.
2. creating a model that is atleast 92%
3. create a model that has few missed churns.
 ###
# importation of libraries
# loading the dataset using pandas and cleaning the dataset.
the cell bellow we load the csv file using pandas.
then we use .head() to beable to see the 1st 5 rows of the dataset.
# basic datacleanin
### finding the .info()
in the cell bellow we see that there are a total of 3333 rows and 21 columns.
we are also able to identify that there are no missing values in this dataset since the non_null count of all the columns add up to 3333.we are also able to identify the data type of each column.
### Droping the non useful columns
 ### encoding the categorical variables
using the get_dummies()
### creating the 1st model the logistic regression
 identfy the features and the targets,trai_test split,scaling,fit() the model,evaluation of the model.
### creating the 2nd model the decision tree model
importing a needed model,identify feature and target,train the model,creat the model,fit the modeland evaluation.
### tuning the decision tree model
importing gridsearchcv,defining grid parameters,running gridsearchcv and fitting the model then evaluating the tuned tree.
# recomendation
###
1. the syria tel company should use the model with the highest accuracy which is the tuned decision tree.
2. they should use the model with the atleast 75% prediction of the churns.
3. they should use the model that has less missed churns.
# Conclusion
this tuned model achieves high predictive accuracy while maintaining strong churn detection , making it more effective for balancing revenue protection and customer retention cost.making it the best choise for the company.
